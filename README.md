# Lq - A lisp like language

## What does Lq mean?

The name **Lq** is derived from *Lisp like language* which could be abbreviated with LÂ³, which is spoken like [elkjubd] which kinda sounds like **Lq**. Not the most creative way to name this project, but it'll do for now.

## Why reinventing the wheel?

Well i'm very interested in how programming languages work. So i figured one of the best ideas to get a glimbs of the inner workings of a programming language, is to write one for yourself.

## Disclaimer

This is not my first attemt to create a programming language, but i still consider myself relativly new to the field. Hence this project does not really attempt to be something actually used in production. I think you technically could, but i would strongly advice you to use something more elaborated and mature, like [newLISP](http://www.newlisp.org/).

## What features does Lq have?

These are the main components.
